title: Higher-Order Functions

<span class="firstcharacter">M</span>any solutions in functional programming involve passing functions as arguments to other functions. Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions are called _higher-order functions_. One of the most common examples of higher-order functions is the `map` function in Python.

When we use those higher-order functions, a group of functions are very often used together:

- `map`: Apply a function to each element in a sequence.
- `filter`: Filter elements in a sequence based on a condition.
- `reduce`: Combine elements in a sequence using a function.
- `sorted`: Sort elements in a sequence using a key function.
- `iter`: Create an iterator from a sequence.
- `max` and `min`: Find the maximum and minimum elements in a sequence.


In this chapter, we will continue to use examples related to text processing to illustrate how to use higher-order functions.


## Sort lines of text based on a custom criterion

Here is the simple text we have:

```text
apple banana cherry date
elephant fox
grape apple orange pear
kiwi lemon mango nectarine
```

Now, we want to sort the lines based on the forth word in each line. If there is no forth word, we will use the last word in the line. 


```python
import pathlib

def line_sort_key(line: str) -> str:
    # set the fourth word as the key
    words = line.split()
    if len(words) >= 4:
        return words[3]
    else:
        # use a sentinel value to keep the short lines at the end
        return '\uffff'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    file_path = pathlib.Path('../data/apple.txt')
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        # read all lines
        lines = f.readlines()
        lines = [line.strip() for line in lines]

    lines.sort() # this will sort the lines based on the first word in each line
    lines.sort(key=line_sort_key) # this will sort the lines based on the forth word in each line
    lines.sort(key=lambda x: len(x)) # this will sort the lines based on the length of each line
```
