title: Higher-Order Functions
layout: post

<span class="firstcharacter">M</span>any solutions in functional programming involve passing functions as arguments to other functions. Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions are called _higher-order functions_. One of the most common examples of higher-order functions is the `map` function in Python.

When we use those higher-order functions, a group of functions are very often used together:

- `map`: Apply a function to each element in a sequence.
- `filter`: Filter elements in a sequence based on a condition.
- `reduce`: Combine elements in a sequence using a function.
- `sorted`: Sort elements in a sequence using a key function.
- `iter`: Create an iterator from a sequence.
- `max` and `min`: Find the maximum and minimum elements in a sequence.
