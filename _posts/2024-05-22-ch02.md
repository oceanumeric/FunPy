title: Higher-Order Functions

<span class="firstcharacter">M</span>any solutions in functional programming involve passing functions as arguments to other functions. Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions are called _higher-order functions_. One of the most common examples of higher-order functions is the `map` function in Python.

When we use those higher-order functions, a group of functions are very often used together:

- `map`: Apply a function to each element in a sequence.
- `filter`: Filter elements in a sequence based on a condition.
- `reduce`: Combine elements in a sequence using a function.
- `sorted`: Sort elements in a sequence using a key function.
- `iter`: Create an iterator from a sequence.
- `max` and `min`: Find the maximum and minimum elements in a sequence.


In this chapter, we will continue to use examples related to text processing to illustrate how to use higher-order functions. Before we start, let's review the basic concepts of higher-order functions.

```python
>>> foo = [2, 3, 4]
>>> map(str, foo)
<map object at 0x10020ac80>
>>> list(map(str,foo))
['2', '3', '4']
```


## Sort lines of text based on a custom criterion

Here is the simple text we have:

```text
apple banana cherry date
elephant fox
grape apple orange pear
kiwi lemon mango nectarine
```

Now, we want to sort the lines based on the forth word in each line. If there is no forth word, we will use the last word in the line. 


```python
import pathlib

def line_sort_key(line: str) -> str:
    # set the fourth word as the key
    words = line.split()
    if len(words) >= 4:
        return words[3]
    else:
        # use a sentinel value to keep the short lines at the end
        return '\uffff'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    file_path = pathlib.Path('../data/apple.txt')
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        # read all lines
        lines = f.readlines()
        lines = [line.strip() for line in lines]

    lines.sort() # this will sort the lines based on the first word in each line
    lines.sort(key=line_sort_key) # this will sort the lines based on the forth word in each line
    lines.sort(key=lambda x: len(x)) # this will sort the lines based on the length of each line
```


## Calculate the number of views before the first purchase

Let's say have a list of entries as follows:

```python
orders = [
    ['VIEW', '10', 'p1'],
    ['PURCHASE', '7', 'p4'],
    ['PURCHASE', '2', 'p2'],
    ['VIEW', '5', 'P1'],
    ['PURCHASE', '3', 'p3'],
    ['VIEW', '3', 'p2']
    ['VIEW', '6', 'p2'],
    ['PURCHASE', '10', 'p2'],
    ['PURCHASE', '8', 'p1'],
    ['VIEW', '4', 'p1'],
    ['VIEW', '6', 'p1'],
    ['VIEW', '9', 'p4'],
    ['PURCHASE', '10', 'p4'],
    ['VIEW', '1', 'p1'],
    ['VIEW', '11', 'p1'],
    ['PURCHASE', '13', 'p1'],
    ['VIEW', '14', 'p1'],
    ['VIEW', '15', 'p3'],
    ['PURCHASE', '16', 'p3'],
    ['VIEW', '17', 'p3'],
]
```

When I first time see this problem, I think I need to write a loop to calculate the number of views before the first purchase. But if you think this problem as a `dataframe` problem, you will find it is very easy to solve this problem with functional programming.
